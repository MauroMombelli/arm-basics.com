## ARM ARCHITECTURE
## UNDERSTAND THE FACTS

1. The cost of licensing an ISA is only a fraction of the investment, but is a fraction you can invest elsewhere.
2. RISC-V has already a great community response well before any HW got released; and thanks to the investment of many tech giant, the community and the quality can only grow!
3. Are you an ISA designer? you think you got the next great idea and have a lot of time and mone to invest? Great, you can create your own extension, and if nailed it, you may make a lot of money. Or miserably sink. Think twice, and see what the community and your user want and need.
4. Security is very important. This is why a modern architecture can prevent newer know CPU issue, like Spectre.
5. Modifing an ISA can be very expansive and dangerous: if you really want to do it, see point 3.
  
bonus. risk still has a lot of road to go, so x86 and ARM had. We cant improve if we don't take some risk
